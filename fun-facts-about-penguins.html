			Penguins are amazing birds! Unlike those birds we usually spot in our backyards, these creatures have adapted to their cold environment, and this alone makes them pretty special.

			Do you want to learn more about penguins? Check these fun facts:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>There are <span>17</span> species of penguins, each slightly different from each other. They all live in the Southern hemisphere.</li>
			<li>Penguins <span>don’t fly</span>. Instead, they have flippers that assist them in the water.</li>
			<li>Explorers first called them <i>“strange geese”</i>.</li>
			<li>Scientists discovered fossils that place their earliest ancestor at some <span>60 million years ago</span>. A relative of these birds survived the mass extinction of dinosaurs.</li>
			<li>Penguins are capable of <span>camouflaging</span>. Their black backs blend with the ocean water when viewed from above, and their white bellies match the surface when seen from below. This way, they can hide from predators like leopard seals and become better at catching their prey.</li>
			<li>They can drink <span>seawater</span>.</li>
			<li>Some penguin species <span></span>. Chinstraps, gentoos, and Rockhoppers are especially monogamous.</li>
			<li>Penguins get their name from a <span>now-extinct</span> Canadian bird, the great auk. Though they are not related, nowadays penguins resemble auks.</li>
			<li>They love <i>“tobogganing”</i>. Many penguins lay on their stomachs and push themselves forward with their feet. It’s often a fast and fun way to get around.</li>
			<li>An entertainment magazine named penguins one of <span>the best things of the 2000s’</span>. They were stars in several movies back in that decade, Happy Feet, Surf’s Up and Madagascar, where the scheming penguins even gained a spin-off a few years later.</li>
		</ul>

			Unfortunately, a rise in the temperature of sea ice will cause changes in their food supply, and disruption of their nesting sites. Let’s rise up and help protect Antarctica’s penguins and their environment. Head to <a href="https://www.graesrod.org/">graesrod.org</a> to start a campaign.
