		<h1 class="center">Bold Norwegian Teen Is Fighting Her Government on Arctic Oil Drilling</h1>

			<span>Elina Berg</span>. Does it ring a bell? If it doesn't, it's time for a refresher: she's that badass teen who is a member of an environmental group suing the Norwegian government over the issuing of new oil drilling licenses in the Arctic.
		</p>
		<p>
			In <span>2016</span>, Greenpeace International and Norway’s Nature and Youth Group filed a lawsuit against Norway. The organizations claimed that by allowing oil drilling, the government was violating the Norwegian constitution.

		</p>
		<p>
			A Norwegian court ruled in favor of the government in January, but the activists are still appealing against the ruling.
		</p>
		<p>
			Elina Berg, a <span>17-year-old</span> member of Norway's Nature and Youth Group, has entered the fight against her government. This battle is far from being over as the groups are planning on appealing the court’s decision.

		</p>
		<p>
			<i>“My worst fear is that there will be an oil spill,”</i> Elina told the BBC, <i>“which is quite probably because of the cold climate up in the arctic.”</i>

		</p>
		<p>
			Norway’s support of Arctic drilling is inconsistent with the country’s support of the Paris climate agreement and its endeavors towards becoming a leader in renewable technologies.

		</p>
		<p>
			<span>So, what does that mean exactly?</span> It means Norway is encouraging its citizens to no longer rely on fossil fuels while being one of the world’s biggest oil producers — with oil and gas as <span>12%</span> of its gross domestic product and more than a third of Norwegian exports.

		</p>
		<p>
			Norway’s domestic feats when it comes to renewable energy are why the environmental groups’ claims that the drilling breached the constitution were denied. The court is saying that the risks were limited ignoring the risks outside of the country.

		</p>
		<p>
			<i>“For the sake of my future, I’m really hoping that we’ll win the appeal,”</i> Elina told the BBC.

		</p>
		<p>
			<i>“And I hope that the judges will take us seriously.”</i> Way to go, Elina!
